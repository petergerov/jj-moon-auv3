/**
    A small, artifact-light pitch shifter, used both for the Shift section's
    micro-detune ("microshift") widening and — since Pitch L/R was widened
    to a full +-1200 cents — for larger, semitone-scale drops dialed in
    directly on Shift's independent per-channel Pitch/Delay controls (as an
    alternative to the dedicated, single-amount PitchDrop.h/Drop section).

    This is the classic dual-tap crossfaded delay-line pitch shifter: two read
    pointers trail the write pointer by a delay that ramps linearly (up or down
    depending on the desired pitch ratio), each weighted by a Hann window that
    is zero exactly when that tap wraps around. The two taps are offset by half
    a grain so their Hann windows sum to a constant 1.0 (50%-overlap COLA
    property), which is what keeps the output level steady and click-free as
    each tap resets.

    The grain length trades off latency/smearing against how audible the
    tap-crossfade rate is at larger shifts (that rate is roughly
    |1 - ratio| * sampleRate / grainLength); PluginProcessor prepares this
    class with a longer grain than the old 35ms default specifically so the
    widened range holds up, at a small cost to micro-shift transient tightness.
