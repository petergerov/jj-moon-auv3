// not here — it belongs in Comp, next to the knobs that cause it. What is
// here is level in and level out, both properties of the whole chain.
//
// Aligned to the top, because the input knob carries a meter under it and
// the other two do not: centring would float MIX and OUTPUT half a meter
// down the plate and break the line their captions share.
