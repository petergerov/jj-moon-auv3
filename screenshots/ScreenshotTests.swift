/// Drives the container app and attaches one PNG per marketing shot.

/// This is an asset generator, not a test of behaviour — it asserts only
/// enough to fail loudly when the UI it aims at has moved. Run it through
/// `screenshots/make-screenshots.sh`, which pulls the attachments out of the
/// result bundle and writes them into `docs/images/` and `screenshots/store/`.
///
/// Everything it captures is the real app on a stock simulator: no device
/// frames, no composited backgrounds, no marketing text laid over the top.
/// App Review rejects screenshots showing UI the app does not have, and a
/// panel this heavily drawn is its own best advertisement anyway.
///
/// One shot per test method, deliberately. Each method gets a fresh launch
/// from `setUp`, so a knob nudged while scrolling in one shot cannot leak
/// into the next — the first draft did them all in one method and the panel
/// arrived at the preset shot with Tone already off its default and the
/// preset LED lit red.
