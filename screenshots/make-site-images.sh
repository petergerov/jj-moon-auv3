# re-measured whenever the panel's vertical order changes. It was 960 while
# the master strip sat at the foot of the panel; moving the strip to the top
# pushed the blocks down by its height, and the old offset then framed the
# strip with the tops of Curve and Comp sliced off — a file still named
# detail-comp showing no Comp knobs at all.
